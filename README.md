Part 1: Binary Classification

A fully connected neural network for binary classification involves creating a network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes or neurons. The input layer receives the image data, and each subsequent layer processes the data through mathematical calculations and non-linear transformations. The output layer produces a binary prediction, either classifying the image as one class or the other.


Part 2: Multi-classification

A fully connected neural network for multi-classification is similar to the binary classification network, but with multiple output classes. Instead of a binary output, the network produces a probability distribution over all classes.

To improve our results and accuracy in the multi-classification we added two experiments. We tried to make changes in a variety of ways, for example: adding layers to the depth of the network, changing the "width" of layers, changing activation functions, or changing hyperparameters related to the network.
